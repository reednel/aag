# Contributing to AAG

The following guidelines are designed for contributors to AAG.

## Reporting Issues and Questions

For reporting a bug, a failed function or requesting a new feature, open an issue in GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/reednel/aag/issues). First, seach through existing issues (open or closed) that might have the answer to your question.

When reporting a bug, it is most helpful to include:

- A quick background/summary
- Specific steps to reproduce, with sample code if you can
- The expected result
- The actual result
- Notes (i.e. why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)
