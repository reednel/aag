The Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld key exchange protocol (AAG) is a less-secure alternative to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, based on conjugation in non-abelian groups. However where Diffie-Hellman is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, there is no known quantum algorithm for efficiently attacking AAG. As a general protocol, AAG is compatible with any non-abelian platform group. Much theoretical research has been done on specific platform groups, but little comparing them.

In this paper we present the first generic implementation of the AAG key exchange. Our implementation is easily extensible to any group defined in SageMath, encompassing a large number of frequently-considered options. We  release our program as a tool for further experimentation with new platform groups and platform-group specific attacks, and demonstrate a comparison between selected groups' resistance to naive brute-force attacks.
